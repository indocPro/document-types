# Knowledge Base

A knowledge base holds information about the software product. The content is structured into categories and articles.

Learn more about creating and managing a knowledge base at https://indoc.pro/documentation-types/multilingual-knowledge-base/ .

## Elements of a knowledge base entry

- Title: short and precise
- Introduction: 2-3 sentences that describe the problem or 
- Content: the message that provides the knowledge to the reader, along with images, videos, screenshots or other rich media.
- Category: the category, this knowledge base entry belongs to

Additional information can be added if available or necessary, as e.g.
- Links to related content: link other content in the knowledge base that might be helpful or relevant
- Prerequisites: required settings, features or task that needs to be satisfied beforehand

## Knowledge base template
The template of a knowledge base document is located in this external file [Knowledge base template](knowledge-base-template.md) for easy copying.

## Knowledge base article sample
The following section provides a very basic knowledge base entry as an example.

### Create a new documentation type

Your favorite software documentation type is missing? Feel free to add it to this repository, so other users get to 
know it. This article describes how to do it. 

### Preparation
- Fork this repository or download it as ZIP file.
- Briefly check the README.md file to understand the background.
- If you provide content to this repository, you grant the right to use it at the same license as this repository is. If you are working for a company, you need the agreement from your employer.

### Initialize the documentation type folder
- Go to the "en" folder and use a matching folder as template. English is the default language and is later translated into the other languages. Feel free to use another language.
- Copy it and rename it to the name of the documentation type (Guideline: Small letters and "-" as word separators.).
- Remove all non-relevant files and content - in the index.md file, and additional files as in _assets.

### Write the content
- Start at index.md and fill in the relevant content. Add sections, and if possible at least a short example or template indicating the usage of this documentation type.
- Add additional resources and files to this directory. Images and other "assets" should be placed in the _assets sub folder.
- Please only add content you have the copyright for. Do not copy internal company-owned property, or other content from external sources. 

### Submit to the main repository
- Check the LICENSE file. Any commits to this repository are subjected to this license. You must agree to provide your content under this license, and you must confirm that you are the owner/creator or are able to license the content.
- Create a new pull request (if you forked the repo) or a new ticket (and attach the new content e.g. as zip file).
- The updated content is reviewed and added to the project. In case there is a problem, you will be informed.
