## Elements of a how-to entry
- Title: should be precise and describe the problem / solution
- Introduction: describe the problem or task with 1-2 short sentences
- Background information: if additional information or knowledge is necessary to successfully progress in the how to guide, add them at the beginning. Keep it short and add links to additional documentation as e.g. product features, glossary or explanations.
- Step-by-step guide: numbered list, with short description, image/screenshot and additional information whenever possible; if multiple options are available describe them and the impact to the desired outcome
- Outcome and solution: describe in detail what the user reached
- Next steps: if there are next steps in a process, or other related documentation that the user might need â€“ list them here, so the user can proceed and is not lost in the journey.
- Potential problems or questions: if there are common problems or questions that the user might encounter during the how-to guide, add them at the end (and maybe reference at the specific step); this educates the user and lowers your support interactions
