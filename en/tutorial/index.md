# Tutorial
A tutorial describes in detail how a specific operation or task is performed. 

Similar to the [onboarding guide](../onboarding-guide/index.md), it is very specific and learning-oriented. At the end of the tutorial, the user fully understands the feature and can use it.

## Typical elements of a tutorial documentation
- Explanation and presentation of the specific feature or process, using screenshots of the user interface – so the user clearly understands the steps. This could be a html-based online document, or a PDF to download and store for later reference.
- Demonstration of the steps to perform as video or screen recording. The tutor or guide should explain in detail what is on the screen and what the button and other UI elements will do. If possible, the element should be grouped into smaller elements that can be watched separately and referenced.
- Questionnaire, exam, survey or online test to measure how much of the relevant content has been understood and memorized by the user. As the result, the user should see in which elements knowledge gaps are and a link to the specific tutorial documentation and video to “re-learn” the missing know how.
