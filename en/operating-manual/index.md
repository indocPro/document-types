# Operating Manual
The operating manual contains all necessary information and tasks to operate and manage a product or object. For software products, the operating manual is mostly relevant for IT operations to install, integrate, manage and upgrade the product.

- Installation and onboarding:
  1. Prerequisites (specific hardware/software/server configuration and requirements, licenses, …) and check lists
  2. Step by step instructions to install software or system, e.g. how to integrate the Single Sign-On between customer’s cloud provider or on-site Active Directory, and the products user authentication module to integrate the employees
  3. How to check and validate the proper functionality of the system
- Monitoring and maintenance of the system – e.g. check disk space, run security and safety audits, backup and recovery of data, archive old data, get and install updates and upgrades
- How to proper uninstall and remove the software by the system engineer for all parts
- Information to handle typical questions and support requests by the end user, for the support department of the customer – e.g. faq, link to support portal of vendor, contact to vendor’s support for 2nd and 3rd level support to get assistance, along with the support level agreement (SLA), along with possible emergency procedures and guidance in case of human error or system outtake
